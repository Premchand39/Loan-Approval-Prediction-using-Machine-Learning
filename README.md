# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
## 📌 Overview  
This project automates the loan approval process using **Machine Learning**.  
We predict whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on customer data.

## 🚀 Dataset  
The dataset consists of information about **loan applicants**, including:  
✔️ **Demographics** (Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education)  
✔️ **Financials** (Income, Credit History, Loan Amount)  
✔️ **Loan Details** (Term, Property Area, Self-Employed Status)  
✔️ **Target Variable**: Loan Status (Approved ✅ / Not Approved ❌)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  

## 📊 Data Preprocessing  
✔️ Handling Missing Values  
✔️ Encoding Categorical Variables  
✔️ Feature Scaling (Standardization)  
✔️ Train-Test Split  

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models  
We evaluated multiple classifiers:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
